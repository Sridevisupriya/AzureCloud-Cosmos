while deploying a web api into azure web app , we need to select serverless and for database connection , we need to add connectionstring in application settings , for webapi to access database.
likewise for angular code deployment we need to install Azure app service from extensions and add a web config file in src. For prod files to get generated we need to  use
npm run ng build --prod  Command in terminal. Everytime we build we need to generate prod files and add web config file in dist folder before deploying code.
